This directory includes the Vending Machine design. 

docs- specification and related tutorials
rtl - four different implementations did by different people.
sim - testbench and related scripts
syn - netlist and related scripts for the 4 implementations
fv  - formal verification scritps: FPV formal property verification; FEV formal equivalence verification; FSV formal safety verification.
fv/tmr - is a redundant version (TMR) of the vending machine which achieves 100% fault coverage for SA0,SA1,SEU faults

So, as students of VFSD2, you wil have to proposed FPV, FEV, and FSV strategies for the vending machine. This will prepare you for the next challenge, which is the router verification.
